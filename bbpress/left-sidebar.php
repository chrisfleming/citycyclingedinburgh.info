<h2>About This Forum</h2>

<p>CityCyclingEdinburgh was launched on the 27th of October 2009 as "an experiment".</p>

<p>
ITâ€™S TRUE!<br>

CCE is <?php
$time_difference = time() - strtotime("2009-10-27");
print_r(round($time_difference/(60*60*24*365)));
?>years old!<br>

Well done to ALL posters<br>
<p>

It soon became <a href = "http://citycyclingedinburgh.info/bbpress/topic.php?id=1&replies=3#post-2137">useful and entertaining</a>. There are regular posters, people who add useful info occasionally and plenty more who drop by to watch.

That's fine. If you want to add news/comments it's easy to register and become a member.</p><p>

<i>RULES</i> No personal insults. No swearing.
