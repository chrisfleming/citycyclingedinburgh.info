Well done to ALL posters</p>

It soon became <a href = "http://citycyclingedinburgh.info/bbpress/topic.php?id=1&replies=3#post-2137">useful and entertaining</a>. There are regular posters, people who add useful info occasionally and plenty more who drop by to watch.

That's fine. If you want to add news/comments it's easy to register and become a member.</p><p>
